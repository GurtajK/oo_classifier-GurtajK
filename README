Assignment 1: OOClassifier

This program This assignment was completed for the fall term in my 2nd year at
university. The primary focus was to apply the concepts of object-oriented
programming which we had been learning throughout the semester.

Included Files:
	* ooclassifier.py
	* README

Reasonable Design Decisions:

	For the list of stopwords I hard coded it in the remove_stops
	method which is called by preprocess_words in training instance.

	For preprocess_words in training instance, I added 3 methods
	under training instance for removing symbols, digits, and
	stopwords. All of these are called by preprocess_words.

	For target_top_n I did not use any other methods because
	I felt that all the code belonged in that class.

	For return_nfolds, I added both the training instances
	and the lines to each training set object that was made
	even though only training instances were explicitly stated.
	I also did this for add_training_set.

	For copy() I simply returned a deepcopy of 'self' which
	represents the object of class TrainingSet().
